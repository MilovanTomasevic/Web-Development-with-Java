       Prvi pasus. All of the base tables and views for the database's data
       dictionary are stored in the schema SYS. These base tables and views
       are critical for the operation of Oracle. To maintain the integrity
       of the data dictionary, tables in the SYS schema are manipulated only
       by Oracle; they should never be modified by any user or database
       administrator, and no one should create any tables in the schema of the
       user SYS. (However, you can change the storage parameters of the data
       dictionary settings if necessary.)
